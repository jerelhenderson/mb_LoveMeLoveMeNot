# Love Me, Love Me Not for [MusicBee](https://getmusicbee.com/)
This plugin is a substitute for MusicBee's built-in [Last.fm](https://last.fm) *Love* toggle hotkey.
It enables separate hotkeys for Loving a track and Unloving a track, eliminating accidental track unloves
that may occur using the single built-in hotkey.

## Installation
Installing MusicBee plugins is easy: just place the DLL in your ..\MusicBee\Plugins folder.
That's it!
